    <h2>Business Analyst</h2>

    <p>Working with the vendor management team at the Port of Portland,
      I helped the PDX Airport during a recruiting process for new tenants during the redesign of their food and shopping facilities.

    <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
    <p> I'm a Jack of all trades, but unlike the saying, a master at all of them.  Through schooling and work,
      I have become an expert in programs like: SQL, Excel, STATA, Outlook, and Keynote.
      <br></br>
      Outside of work/school I pursue my hobbies of baking and being one bad man in regards to all things sport.
      Along with baking as a hobbie, throughout my high school years I worked as a Farmers Market organizer for Fleur de Lis Bakery.
      Learning about all things bread and pastry, I quickly developed a knack for selling these goods and also a strong desire to start baking
      these staples on my own time.
