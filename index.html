    <h2>Fraud and Risk Investigator</h2>
    <p>Monitoring transactions and trends through data dives, I help combat global fraud on Airbnb digital platforms.
      Working directly with other teams, I help identify weaknesses in product and suggest improvements which help save the company large sums of money.
      Partnering frequently with the change management team, I help write workflows for new fraud types through effective project
      management/data organization and working directly with key stakeholders.

    <h2>Business Analyst</h2>
    <p>Working with the vendor management team at the Port of Portland,
      I helped the PDX Airport during a recruiting process for new tenants during the redesign of their food and shopping facilities.
      Helping select tenants based on sales records and foot traffic at PDX, I was able to help by analyzing sales data to
      show who would maximize the potential sales for each lease.
