    <h1>BUSINESS ANALYST @ PORT OF PORTLAND</h1>
    <h2>August 2013 - June 2014</h2>
    <p>Working with the vendor management team at the Port of Portland, I helped the PDX Airport during a recruiting process for new tenants during the redesign
      of their food and shopping facilities.  Helping select tenants based on sales records and foot traffic at PDX, I was able to help by showing who would maximize the potential for
      each lease and identify areas for improvement based on sales data from previous tenants.

    <p>"Joey, thank you for showing me the incredible project you are championing.
      This is so cool and very far out of my league but you could explain it in a way that I understood and I am so, so excited.
      I am so impressed with your drive and your work.”</p>
      <p><strong>Tara Yeiter/Team Lead/Tara.Yeiter@Airbnb.com</strong></p>
      <p>"Joey! You have been so helpful and flexible as we all try to learn the ropes of the Gladiator program.
        You fearlessly take on ridiculous requests that we aren't even sure are possible, and you deliver amazing results every time.
        Thank you for your support throughout this project and I'm so happy to get this opportunity to work with you.”</p>
